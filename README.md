## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was built using an API that returns word definitions, pronounciations and more. Once a user enters a word, it's put into the query parameter. The data returned is then shown to the user.

## Lessons Learned:

It was great seeing how sites like defintion checkers or synonym finders might be built. It really pulls the sheet of the magic act in some ways.
